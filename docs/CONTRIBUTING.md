# Contributing
Thank you for contributing to ReactVancouver open source projects!

## Choosing an issue

üí° **TIP:** Get feedback from the core maintainers and / or community before jumping into code.

_If you do know what you want to contribute‚Ä¶_

‚Üí Create an issue using a template:
- Feature: if you want to implement something new.
- Bug: if you want to fix something broken.

_If you don‚Äôt know what you want to contribute‚Ä¶_

‚Üí Look at the open [issues](https://github.com/React-Vancouver/cms/issues). If you are just starting out, look for _good first issue_ tags. Comment on the issue to discuss the implementation plan or reach out to core maintainers on Slack.

## Working on issues
1. Create a new branch for your work:
  1.1 off `project` branch if you are contributing to a larger project,
  1.2 off `production` if you are contributing an individual feature or fix.
2. The naming convention for branches is `[feature|fix]/[issue-number]/[issue-name]` (eg `feature/3/add-readme`)

```bash
git checkout -b feature/3/add-readme
yarn && yarn start
```

## Pull Request Process
1. Open a PR against a project or production branch  depending on what you were working on.
2. Get at least one review.
3. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off from a core maintainer (see `CODEOWNERS`).

If you were working on a project, the project branch will be merged into `production` when it is complete and ready for release.
